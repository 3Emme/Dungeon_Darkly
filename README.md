## Description

Harken back to the days of text adventures, MUDs and RPGs! _Dungeon Darkly_

of guts, glory, and goods. 

As a minimun viable product, this game 
1. Uses a retro UI in homage to the classic text adventure experience
1. Allows for character customization options, including multiple race and class possibilites
1. Creates a playable tutorial quest
1. Includes the following basic game mechanics: movement, exploration, and combat

Originally built as a JavaScript capstone project for Epicodus, we have plans to continue buidling out this game because, why wouldn't we?
